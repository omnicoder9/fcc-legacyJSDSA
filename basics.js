//In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. 
//JavaScript provides eight different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object.

//variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, $, _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number
//string literal/string: a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes

/* 
When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. 
If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". 
If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a string of undefined.
*/

//best practice: Write variable names in JavaScript in camelCase. In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.

//One of the biggest problems with declaring variables with the var keyword is that you can easily overwrite variable declarations.
//A keyword called let was introduced in ES6, a major update to JavaScript, to solve this potential issue with the var keyword. You'll learn about other ES6 features in later challenges.
//So unlike var, when you use let, a variable with the same name can only be declared once.

//const has all the awesome features that let has, with the added bonus that variables declared using const are read-only. They are a constant value, which means that once a variable is assigned with const, it cannot be reassigned

//Note: It is common for developers to use uppercase variable identifiers for immutable values and lowercase or camelCase for mutable values (objects and arrays).

//The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.
//Note: The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the modulus operator. It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with negative numbers.

//compound assignment with augmented division
